IMDB 50K Reviews Sentiment Analysis 📡

• Object: Build a model to accurately classify movie reviews from the IMDB dataset as positive or negative. • Data: Utilize the IMDB dataset containing 50,000 movie reviews with sentiment labels (positive or negative). • Methodology: Data Preprocessing: 🧹

EDA: Clean the text data (remove punctuation, convert to lowercase, handle missing values).
Tokenize the text (split into individual words or subwords).
Use stopwords to remove common words (e.g., "the," "a," "is," "are,").
• Feature Extraction: 🔍 CountVectorizer: in NLP transforms text data into a numerical representation (a matrix of token counts) that machine learning models can understand.

• Apply Machine Learning Algorithm: 🔬 Multinomial Naïve Bayes: Multinomial Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier that uses Bayes' theorem to predict the class of a document based on the frequency of words in the document. • Apply Deep Learning Algorithm: 🔗 LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory): LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that addresses the vanishing gradient problem, enabling it to learn and remember long-term dependencies in sequential data.

For topic modelling: 📝
using Lda LDA (Linear Discriminant Analysis) is a statistical method used for dimensionality reduction and classification by finding linear combinations of features that best separate different classes.
